The Android OS environment is today increasingly targeted by
malware. Traditional signature based detection algorithms are not
able to provide complete protection especially against ad-hoc created
malwares. In this paper, we introduce an anomaly-based approach
to assess whether an application is malicious or not on the
basis of applications permissionsâ€™ and related APIs exploiting the
advantages of machine learning algorithms combining different fusion
rules. We study the performance of our approach in terms of
false alarms tradeoff. Results demonstrate that our approach reach
an equal error rate as little as 5.59% depending on the configuration.
